# Python_API_Challenge


This repository contains two parts: WeatherPy and VacationPy.


## WeatherPy


In WeatherPy, there is a script that visualizes the weather of 500+ unique cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. Weather data is collected by API calls from OpenWeatherMap.org.


There are a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:


- Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
- Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
- Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
- Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude


There is an analysis included for each graph.


In addition to the above visualizations, scatter plots and linear regressions are run on the following relationships:


- Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude


For each plot, there is an explain about what the linear regression is analyzing along with further analysis of the data.


The output_data file will include:


- A CSV of the clean weather data
- All plots saved as PNG images



## VacationPy


This file includes a heat map that displays the humidity for every city found in WeatherPy.


Google Places API will be used to acquire caf√©, restaurant, and museum data for Seoul, Korea. The data collected will be displaced on a map for visualization. 


The output_data file will include:


- All maps created


Along with what we learned in class, I also used the following resources to complete this assignment:
